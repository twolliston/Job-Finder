# Job Finder

### This was a collaborative group project for the UCF Coding Bootcamp. Requirements of the assignment were to utilize 2 or more API's, Use a technology that is new to us, and use a database to store persistent data. Our group decided to make a job finder application that utilizes the Google Maps API, Google Places API, and Career One Stop Api. It also uses complete user authentication and a Google Firebase Database.
